### üí° Business Task
To gain insights into how customers are utilizing smart devices and how this information can inform our marketing strategy, we need to conduct a comprehensive analysis.

## üíª Prepare 
**Information about dataset**
- FitBit Fitness Tracker Data was used as the data source for this case study. This dataset is housed in Kaggle, is accessible via Mobius, and was generated by responders to an Amazon Mechanical Turk distributed poll dated 04.12.2016 05.12.2016.

- The data is licenced under CC0: Public Domain, with the author relinquishing all of his or her rights to the work under copyright law worldwide, including all related and neighbouring rights, to the extent permissible by law.

- The dataset is made up of 18.csv files. 15 in long format, 3 in broad format. The databases contain a wide range of information such as activity metrics, calories, sleep records, heart rate, and steps in seconds, minutes, hours, and days.

- The data has some drawbacks, such as a very small sample size, and the time span of the dataset is also not optimal.

## üõ† Process
**Setting Up Environment**
```
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
import datetime as dt
```
**Importing the dataset**<br>
The dataset has 18 csv files, however the majority of them have been merged into a single file called dailyActivity_merged.csv, which will be my primary focus. I'll also use certain files that weren't merged into this particular one

```
daily_activity = pd.read_csv('.../Fitabase Data/dailyActivity_merged.csv')
daily_activity.head()
```

**Exploring dataset** <br>
We will be working with 2 files
```
daily_activity.describe()
```

**Cleaning the dataset**<br>
Modifying the ActivityDate column By changing its datatype and format

```
daily_activity['ActivityDate'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_activity['ActivityDate'],format ='%m/%d/%Y')
```
```
hourly_intensity['ActivityHour'] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_intensity['ActivityHour'],format = '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
```
<br>
To provide reliable insights, the datasets shown above were thoroughly reviewed for missing values and duplicates, as well as appropriately cleaned and formatted.

## üìä Analyze
It is now time to analyse the provided datasets in order to extract relevant information.
```
print("No of unique values: ",daily_activity['Id'].nunique())
print("No of unique values: ",hourly_intensity['Id'].nunique())
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/70436e13-65a9-4422-84f3-3a2634f0370e)</kbd> <br>

This dataset is made up of data gathered from 33 distinct individuals over a period of two months.

```
daily_activity['weekdays'] = daily_activity['ActivityDate'].dt.day_name()
daily_activity.head()
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/4cf564e1-80f3-4421-93cb-ae532579fa8d)</kbd> <br>

```
day_order = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

daily_activity['weekdays'] = pd.Categorical(daily_activity['weekdays'], categories=day_order, ordered=True)
```

```
average_daily_steps = daily_activity.groupby('weekdays').agg(mean_total_steps=('TotalSteps', 'mean')).reset_index()

daily_activity['avg_steps'] = daily_activity['TotalSteps'].mean()
summary_avg_steps = daily_activity['avg_steps'].describe()

overall_avg = daily_activity['avg_steps'].mean()
```

```
print("Average daily steps grouped by day of the week:")
print(average_daily_steps)

print("\nSummary of avg_steps:")
print(summary_avg_steps)

print("\nOverall average of avg_steps:")
print(overall_avg)
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/77a8fed8-dcc4-4c8e-a2af-ca6b320669b2) </kbd> <br>

I created an additional column to the dataset in the code shown above to calculate the days of the week using the date provided because I want to determine what day of the week is the most steps taken.I took average steps and then used the groupby() function to group them with the days of the week

```
very_active_mins = daily_activity['VeryActiveMinutes'].sum()
fairly_active_mins = daily_activity['FairlyActiveMinutes'].sum()
lightly_active_mins = daily_activity['LightlyActiveMinutes'].sum()
sedentary_mins = daily_activity['SedentaryMinutes'].sum()

print("Very Active Minutes:", very_active_mins)
print("Fairly Active Minutes:", fairly_active_mins)
print("Lightly Active Minutes:", lightly_active_mins)
print("Sedentary Minutes:", sedentary_mins)
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/06436448-010d-4f81-bc0d-900cac17bdb4)</kbd> <br>

Now analyzing the other file

```
hourly_intensity['hour'] = hourly_intensity['ActivityHour'].dt.hour
Avevrage_Intensity = hourly_intensity.groupby('hour').agg(AverageIntensity=('AverageIntensity', 'sum')).reset_index()
print(Avevrage_Intensity)
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/7a5cb86c-3c7e-44fd-89f4-36f692c980fd)</kbd><br>

I divided the ActivityHour column into two columns, one for the date and one for the hour, with the goal of analysing the time of day when users are the most active

## üìã Share
**Visualization of Data**<br>
Its now time to visualize our finding and present it to the stakeholder

#### Relationship between average steps and days of the week

```
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.bar(average_daily_steps['weekdays'], average_daily_steps['mean_total_steps'], color='blue')
plt.axhline(y=overall_avg, color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=1)
plt.text(6, overall_avg, 'Average Steps', color='black', ha='right', va='bottom')
plt.title('Average Steps Taken on Each Day')
plt.xlabel('Day of the week')
plt.ylabel('Average Steps')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/f4ed2e65-c87d-46d9-89b4-47f42ca99a87)</kbd><br>

We can observe that the bar crosses the average line with a larger margin on Tuesday and Saturday, with a narrower margin on Monday, and with barely inches to spare on Wednesday. Other days are below average. <br>

#### Tracking Activity

```
slices = [very_active_mins, fairly_active_mins, lightly_active_mins, sedentary_mins]
labels = ["Very active minutes", "Fairly active minutes", "Lightly active minutes", "Sedentary minutes"]
colours = ['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#'#2ca02c', '#d62728']
explode = [0, 0, 0, 0.1]
explode = [0, 0, 0, 0.1]
plt.style.use("default")
plt.pie(slices, labels = labels, 
        colors = colours, wedgeprops = {"edgecolor": "black"}, 
        explode = explode, autopct = "%1.1f%%")
plt.title("Percentage of Activity in Minutes")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
<kbd>![Image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/8f91a584-002f-45b4-9cae-e3fca89d1c0e)</kbd><br>

Here, it is clear that the sedantary rate is the greatest, at 81.3%, implying that most of the time individuals aren't extremely active. Lightly active minutes account for 15.8%, while faily active minutes and very active minutes account for only 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively <br>

#### Relation between hour and average intensity

```
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(Avevrage_Intensity['hour'], Avevrage_Intensity['AverageIntensity'], color='red', marker='o', linestyle='-')
plt.title('Hourly Average Intensity')
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day')
plt.ylabel('Average Intensity')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/6c0aa231-2579-4933-86fd-2ce509371168)</kbd><br>

We concluded that the average intensity increases throughout the day, beginning in the afternoon.<br>

#### Corelation between Total Distance and Calories

Total Steps and Calories are directly proportional; the more steps you take, the more calories you'll burn. Total Steps and Total Distance also exhibit a positive tendency, we're looking for a relationship between Total Distance and Calories here.

```
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=daily_activity, x='TotalDistance', y='Calories', color='blue', label='Data points')
sns.regplot(data=daily_activity, x='TotalDistance', y='Calories', scatter=False, color='green', label='Smooth line')
plt.title('Total Distance vs Calories')
plt.xlabel('Total Distance')
plt.ylabel('Calories')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
<kbd>![image](https://github.com/MaryamRafiquee/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project/assets/170947012/1823c6fc-39d1-4c8a-8340-1e1362d6440f)</kbd><br>

We discovered that total distance and calories also exhibit a positive trend.

### üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Act
After studying the datasets, I came to certain conclusions and produced some recommendations that will aid Bellabeat's marketing approach
